ns1-ansible-modules
====================

This role is the home for all NS1 specific modules.

Project Overview
================

NS1 is an authoritative DNS platform providing data-driven global traffic routing and a fully featured REST API. This module unlocks some of the functionality NS1 can offer for ansible. For more information about what is possible check out [ns1.com](ns1.com) and [api docs](https://ns1.com/api/).

Completed Modules:
 - ns1_zone
 - ns1_record

Still Needed:
 - ns1_facts
 - ns1_data_source
 - ns1_data_feed
 - ns1_monitoring_job

Installation
============

Install this from ansible-galaxy. `ansible-galaxy install cruisibesares.ns1`. You will need the ns1 python client version 0.9.2 or greater. This can be installed by running: `pip install nsone`. Additional information can be found here [nsone-python](https://github.com/nsone/nsone-python)

Testing
=======

This module is tested by using ansible directly. 

	git clone https://github.com/ns1/ns1-ansible-modules.git
	cd ns1-ansible-modules
	ansible-playbook -i local, test.yml --extra-vars key=<your ns1 api key> --extra-vars debug=yes --extra-vars test_zone=<a zone you have at ns1>

The debug flag is optional. You can use any test zone to get started, the only requirement is that it's not yet defined on the NS1 platform. That is, you do not need to make the zone authoritative through your registrar for the ansible module to work correctly.

The current version of the module has been tested with ansible 1.9.2 and python 2.7.10.

Examples
========

Check out test.yml which is all working ansible code. All of the resources try to model the [api](https://ns1.com/api/) objects as closely as possible. We will be adding the standard ansible documentation to the modules themselves shortly.

Contributing
============

Contributions, ideas and criticisms are all welcome. Please keep the ansible test.yml up to date if you do wind up hacking on the project.

Notes:
=====
When creating filters on records you have to use the full syntax required by the REST API to prevent ansible from updating the resources each time. For example the filters field should look like 

	filters:
	  - filter: "up"
	    config: {}

 Not

 	filters:
 	  - filter: {}

 Even though it still creates the correct resources. It calls out to the api to update each time.
